# Encryption and Decryption Tool V2

This tool is designed for encrypting and decrypting text using various algorithms. Users can enter their text and select one of the available algorithms for encryption or decryption.

## Algorithms

### 1. Caesar Cipher
This is a type of symmetric encryption where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed amount. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter A becomes D.

- **Encryption Method**: `encryptCaesar(text, shift)`
- **Decryption Method**: `decryptCaesar(text, shift)`

### 2. Vigen√®re Cipher
This algorithm uses a keyword to shift letters. Each letter in the keyword corresponds to letters in the plaintext, and the shift is calculated based on the position of the letter in the keyword.

- **Encryption Method**: `encryptVigenere(text, key)`
- **Decryption Method**: `decryptVigenere(text, key)`

### 3. XOR Cipher
In this algorithm, each letter is XORed with a character from the key. This process is the same for both encryption and decryption.

- **Encryption Method**: `encryptXOR(text, key)`
- **Decryption Method**: `decryptXOR(text, key)`

### 4. Random Offset
This algorithm generates a random offset for encryption. It offers more security compared to the other methods by using a variable shift.

- **Encryption Method**: `encryptRandomOffset(text)`
- **Decryption Method**: `decryptRandomOffset(text)`
